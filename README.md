# **Context-Aware Reasoning Agent for Semantic Search**

## **Overview**

**IntelliSearch** is an intelligent retrieval system that combines the capabilities of **LangChain ReAct agents**, **vector-based semantic search**, and the **Llama3 large language model** to deliver accurate and context-aware information retrieval.  
This project demonstrates how to integrate reasoning-based agents with efficient vector storage to achieve high-performance document understanding and querying.

## **Key Features**

### 🧠 **Agent-Oriented Query Processing**
Leverages **LangChain’s ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) agents** to break down user queries into interpretable reasoning steps, enabling structured multi-hop retrieval and response generation.

### 📚 **Data Extraction & Preprocessing**
Automatically extracts textual data from documents (e.g., PDFs), performs tokenization, cleaning, and segmentation into retrievable chunks optimized for embedding generation.

### 🔍 **Vector-Based Retrieval**
Implements high-dimensional vector search using custom embeddings to efficiently locate relevant document chunks based on semantic similarity, rather than just keyword matching.

### ⚙️ **Llama3 Language Model Integration**
Uses **Llama3**, a high-performance large language model, to interpret natural language queries, refine search intents, and generate contextually accurate responses.

### 🧩 **Custom Tools and Functions**
Provides extensibility for domain-specific retrieval tools—such as querying by attributes like entity type, age, health parameters, or metadata filters.

## **System Architecture**

1. **Data Layer** – Ingests and preprocesses document data for vectorization.  
2. **Embedding Layer** – Converts text chunks into embeddings using transformer-based models.  
3. **Vector Storage Layer** – Stores and indexes embeddings for efficient similarity-based retrieval.  
4. **ReAct Agent Layer** – Interprets user intent, orchestrates retrieval, and manages reasoning chains.  
5. **LLM Response Layer** – Synthesizes results using contextual understanding powered by Llama3.  
6. **User Interface Layer** – Provides an intuitive interface for query input and result exploration.

## **Setup and Usage**

1. Prepare your document dataset (PDF, text, or structured files).  
2. Preprocess and embed documents using the preprocessing pipeline.  
3. Initialize the vector store and index all embeddings.  
4. Run the agent-based retrieval pipeline using LangChain and Llama3.  
5. Launch the Gradio interface for interactive querying.

## **File Size Recommendations**

| Parameter | Recommended Value |
|------------|------------------|
| **Chunk Size** | 1000 tokens (default) |
| **Max Results per Query** | 4 (configurable) |
| **Supported File Types** | PDF, TXT |

These values balance retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency for typical document sizes.

## **Performance**

| Metric | Typical Range | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------|
| **First Run** | ~30–60 seconds | Initializes embeddings and vector storage |
| **Subsequent Queries** | 5–15 seconds | Depends on document size and query complexity |
| **Memory Usage** | ~1-4 GB | Varies with document size and embedding model |

Performance can be optimized further by caching embeddings and using smaller transformer models for lightweight deployments.
